		<h2>Strategy</h2>
		<p>The design strategy is based on an analysis of the site's elevation, slope and landscape elements, identifying sites suitable for different activities and adding features to enrich the experience of local residents and visitors. </p>

		<h2>Cable car</h2>
		<p>Our main idea is to create an approach for the locals and the tourists. The proposal starts with the cable car bottom station which is located alongside the main road giving it direct connectivity with the Tresenda-Aprica Train Station. It takes around only 2 minutes to reach the top station saving plenty of time of the users.</p>

		<h3>Cable car section</h3>

		<h2>Lake Somasassa area</h2>
		<p>After reaching the Top station, the journey continues on foot until the next stop of Lake Somasassa arrives. The lake consists of a floating platform, tree pavilion,  waterfront steps, sightseeing deck and restaurants. The nearby bicycle parking makes its easier for the cyclists to use the lake and the pathways. The lake then connects to the central part which takes around 12 minutes to reach to the tower portion. </p>

		<h2>Central area</h2>
		<p>The central part is full of adventurous and observation points while creating some resting spaces on the way. On the other hand,  the tower part  is solely devoted to sightseeing and easy access. It takes around 20 minutes to reach the Bell tower which is the main landmark of Teglio.</p>
		<p>In total the journey takes around 44 minutes making it quicker than the initial way.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>With our proposal we were able to achieve the aim of creating a leisure pathway which not only saves time, but also give its users some adventurous and worth remembering experience. The pathway being all ramped makes it accessible to all kind of users and ages. </p>
		<p>Our project of ‘THE ROAD NOT TAKEN’ thus enables you to take the road not taken.</p>
